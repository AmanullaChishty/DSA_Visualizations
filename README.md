This interactive visualization demonstrates:
ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
Live Hash Table Operations: You can insert, search, and delete key-value pairs in real-time and see exactly how the hash table responds.
Visual Bucket Structure: Each bucket is displayed with its index and contents, making it easy to understand how chaining works for collision resolution.
Step-by-Step Algorithm: The visualization highlights each step of the hash table operations:

Hash Computation: Shows how the hash function converts keys to indices
Bucket Access: Demonstrates accessing the correct bucket
Linear Search: Shows searching through the bucket's linked list
Operation Execution: Performs the actual insert/update/delete/find

Real-Time Statistics: Displays current size, capacity, load factor, and collision count.
Hash Function Demo: Shows the actual hash computation for any key you enter.
Operation Log: Tracks all operations with timestamps and results.
ðŸ”§ How to Use

Enter a key and value in the input fields
Click PUT to insert/update a key-value pair
Click GET to search for a key
Click DELETE to remove a key
Watch the algorithm steps light up as operations execute
Observe collisions when multiple keys hash to the same bucket

ðŸŽ¨ Visual Elements

Animated Steps: Each algorithm step is highlighted during execution
Color-Coded Buckets: Different colors for empty vs. filled buckets
Collision Visualization: See how multiple key-value pairs chain in the same bucket
Hash Function Animation: Real-time demonstration of key â†’ hash â†’ index conversion

ðŸ“Š Learning Outcomes
This visualization helps you understand:

How hash functions distribute keys across buckets
Why collisions occur and how chaining resolves them
The relationship between load factor and performance
The step-by-step process of hash table operations
How the choice of hash function affects distribution

Try entering different keys to see how they distribute across the buckets, and notice how some keys might collide (hash to the same bucket) while others don't. This hands-on experience makes the abstract concepts of hash tables much more concrete and memorable!
